title: "1248 Count Number of Nice Subarrays"

Given an array of integers nums and an integer k. A subarray is called nice if there are k odd numbers on it.

Return the number of nice sub-arrays.

**Example 1:**
```$xslt
Input: nums = [1,1,2,1,1], k = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: The only sub-arrays with 3 odd numbers are [1,1,2,1] and [1,2,1,1].
```

**Example 2:**
```$xslt
Input: nums = [2,4,6], k = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no odd numbers in the array.
```

**Example 3:**
```$xslt
Input: nums = [2,2,2,1,2,2,1,2,2,2], k = 2
Output: 16
